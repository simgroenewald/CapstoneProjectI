Software Engineering Boot Camp - Task 12

A small tool for finance calculators

Compulsory Task 1
For this task, assume that you have been approached by a small financial
company and asked to create a program that allows the user to access
two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home
loan repayment calculator.
● Create a new Python file in this folder called finance_calculators.py.
● At the top of the file include the line ‘import math’
● Write the code that will do the following:
1. The user should be allowed to choose which calculation they
want to do. The first output that the user sees when the
program runs should look like this :
How the user capitalises their selection should not affect how
the program proceeds. I.e. ‘Bond’, ‘bond’, ‘BOND’ or
‘investment’, ‘Investment’, ‘INVESTMENT’, etc. should all be
recognised as valid entries. If the user doesn’t type in a valid
input, show an appropriate error message.
2. If the user selects ‘investment’, do the following:
■ Ask the user to input:
● The amount of money that they are depositing.
● The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number
of the interest rate should be entered - don’t worry
about having to deal with the added ‘%’, e.g. The user
should enter 8 and not 8%.
● The number of years they plan on investing for.
● Then ask the user to input whether they want “simple”
or “compound” interest, and store this in a variable
called ‘interest’. Depending on whether they typed
“simple” or “compound”, output the appropriate
amount that they will get after the given period at the
interest rate. Look below in “Interest formulae” for the
formulae to be used.
Interest formulae:
Simple interest rate is calculated as follows: A = P(1 + r * t)
The Python equivalent is very similar: A =P*(1+r*t)
Compound interest rate is calculated as follows: A = P(1 + r) ^ t
The Python equivalent is slightly different: A = P* math.pow((1+r),t)
In the formulae above:
● ‘r’ below is the interest entered above divided by 100, e.g. if 8% is
entered, then r is 0.08.
● ‘P’ is the amount that the user deposits.
● ‘t’ is the number of years that the money is being invested for.
■ Print out the answer!
■ Try enter 20 years and 8 (%) and see what a difference there
is depending on the type of interest rate!
3. If the user selects ‘bond’, do the following:
■ Ask the user to input:
● The present value of the house. E.g. 100000
● The interest rate. E.g. 7
● The number of months they plan to take to repay the
bond. E.g. 120
Bond repayment formula:
The amount that a person will have to be repaid on a home loan is each
month is calculated as follows: repayment = PV\((1 - (1-(r/100)) -n )\r)
In the formulae above:
● ‘PV’ is the present value of the house.
● ‘r’ is the interest rate per period.
● ‘n’ is the number of months over which the bond will be repaid.
■ Calculate how much money the user will have to repay each
month and output the answer.
